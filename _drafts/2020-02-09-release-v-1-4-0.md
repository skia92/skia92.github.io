Noir is developed using and hosted with GitHub. You can head on over to the [GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repo }}) to download it, report any bugs, and to request features.

If you prefer to install the gem version of the theme you can do so [here](https://rubygems.org/gems/noir-for-jekyll).

Here are all of the changes in this latest release:

#### CHANGELOG

<span class="improved">IMPROVED</span> Refined the style of figure captions.

<span class="added">ADDED</span> Last modified date for posts, include `last_modified_at:` in the post's front matter in order to utilize the feature. I went this route instead
of it automatically being added whenever the post file is modified to avoid changes which do not actually alter the content of the post from marking it as updated.

<span class="soon">COMING SOON</span> Per-post author bio.

<span class="soon">COMING SOON</span> A true black dark mode toggle for OLED displays.

This theme is a constant work in progress. If you have any issues, questions or suggestions please send them [my way](https://github.com/essentialenemy)...and thank you for your interest in Noir!
