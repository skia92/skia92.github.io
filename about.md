Hello, fellow buddy!

Thanks for visiting my blog. You may find useful contents or useless one (The useless may be useful for someone!)

I'm a master student and software devleoper. I'm currently studying at [Ajou Univ.](http://www.ajou.ac.kr)
I live in Suwon, South Korea. I love Bach, Schubert, Chopin, especially but overall, I love all classical musics.
When it comes to technology or computer matter, I love Python, systematic architecture and Vim.
