I am a 1st-year Ph.D. student at University of Virginia (UVa). 
I was a member of CSL at Ajou University and my advisor was Prof. [JeongSeob Ahn](https://sites.google.com/view/cslajou/).
I am currently interested in computer systems in various domains.

My past projects were mainly related to persistent memory and memory management in a NUMA architecture.
